                    <ul>
                        <li>Policies and procedures to govern the privacy of client information</li>
                        <li>Limiting access to your personal health information to only those required to deliver service to you.</li>

                <h3>Limits on Confidentiality of Personal Health Information</h3>
                <p>
                    No personal information will be communicated directly or indirectly to any third party without
                    the client’s express written consent, except when there is a legal obligation to release personal
                    health information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following are examples of matters in which a therapist has a duty to report, or disclose
                    information:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <span className="underline">Harm to self:</span> If a therapist has reason to believe that a client is in danger of
                        physically harming themselves in ways that may be life-threatening, a therapist will
                        direct them to access emergency hospital services and/or contact a family member,
                        close other, or another person such as a police officer who may be able to help
                        protect the client. There may be other emergency health care related circumstances
                        where disclosure is reasonably necessary for the protection of health, in which case a
                        therapist will disclose personal information to other health care professionals as long
                        as a client has not expressly prohibited the therapist from doing so.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className="underline">Harm to others:</span> If a therapist has reason to believe that a client is threatening
                        physical violence against another person, the therapist is required to take some
                        action (such as contacting the police, notifying the other person, seeking
                        hospitalization for the client, or some combination of these actions) to ensure that
                        the other person is protected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className="underline">Abuse/Neglect:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If a therapist has reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 is
                                being abused or neglected, the therapist is legally obligated to report this
                                matter to the Children’s Aid Society.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If a therapist suspects or is informed of unlawful conduct that resulted in
                                harm or risk of harm to a resident of a Long-Term Care Facility or
                                Retirement Home, or that a resident is being harmed or is at risk of
                                being harmed in any way (e.g., sexual or physical abuse, neglect,
                                misappropriation of resident’s funds), the therapist may be required to
                                contact the applicable Ministry or Regulatory Authority and report all
                                relevant information.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className="underline">Sexual Abuse:</span> If a therapist learns that a client has been sexually or physically
                        abused by a member of a regulated health profession, the therapist is required to
                        report this information in accordance with the guidelines of the therapist’s applicable
                        regulatory college. The client’s name will not be released without their consent
                        unless such release is court ordered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span className="underline">Court Order:</span> A therapist and clinical record can be subpoenaed by a court order. A
                        therapist can be required to testify and give information obtained during sessions.
                        Without a court order, this information would never be provided voluntarily without
                        a client’s direct request or consent.  If disclosure of personal information is required
                        or allowed by law or by order of a court, a therapist will not release more
                        information than is required or allowed.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Access and Correction of Personal Health Information</h3>
                <p>
                    With only a few exceptions, you have the right to access the personal health information we
                    collect about you. We ask you to put your request in writing, by sending an email to
                    cassandra@therapyintheclouds.ca . If there are limitations to such access, we will inform you
                    within 30 days. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for such requests. Within 30 days
                    after receiving the request for access, the health information custodian may extend the time limit
                    under certain circumstances, for a further period of time of not more than 30 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As outlined in Ontario’s PHIPA, if a health information custodian has granted an individual
                    access to a record of his or her personal health information and if the individual believes that the
                    record is inaccurate or incomplete for the purposes for which the custodian has collected, uses or
                    has used the information, the individual may request in writing that the custodian correct the
                    record. As soon as possible in the circumstances but no later than 30 days after receiving a
                    request for a correction, the health information custodian shall, by written notice to the
                    individual, grant or refuse the individual’s request or extend the deadline for replying for a
                    period of not more than 30 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will not correct a record that was not originally created by a member of the Therapy in the
                    Clouds team and we do not have sufficient knowledge, expertise or authority to correct the
                    record. We will also not correct a record if the information requested to be corrected is a
                    professional opinion or observation that was made in good faith about an individual. We also
                    will not make a correction if we believe on reasonable grounds that a correction request is
                    frivolous, vexatious or in bad faith.
                </p>

                <h3>Retention and Destruction of Personal Health Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Therapy in the Clouds stores personal information only for as long as is necessary for the
                    purpose for which it was collected in accordance with the laws, ethics and standards applicable
                    to members of the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers or such other
                    applicable regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Records are retained for at least seven years from the date of last interaction with the client, or
                    from seven years from the client’s 18th birthday, whichever is later, as in accordance with the
                    O.C.S.W.S.S.W.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When your personal information is no longer required to be maintained, it will be destroyed in
                    accordance with applicable laws.
