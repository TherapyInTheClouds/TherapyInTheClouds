        Billing information: Please note: Therapy in the Clouds does not provide direct billing to

        session.  Clients will be provided with a receipt for service, including
        the therapist’s name, designation, and registration number. Payment is
        accepted by e-transfer only to cassandra@therapyintheclouds.ca

         Cancellation and missed session policy: Please be
        advised that each client session is scheduled specifically for you, thus
        we ask you provide a minimum of 24-hour notice if you are requesting to
        reschedule or cancel your appointment.  If such notice is not received a
        minimum of 24 hours prior to the session start time, the full fee is
        required for the session.
